# Practical Malware Analysis Lab01-01.exe Walk Through

## VirusTotal Report

* All kinds of Trojan gens
* Win32.Malware gen(of course)

## When were the files compiled

* 2010/12/19 UTC

## Packed or obfuscated

*PEview*

### Lab01-01.exe

|.text | .rdata | .data
---|---|---|---
Virtual Size | 0x970 | 0x2b2 | 0xfc
Size of Raw Data |0x1000 | 0x1000 | 0x1000 

### Lab01-01.dll

|.text | .rdata | .data | .reloc
---|---|---|---|---
Virtual Size | 0x39e | 0x23fc6 | 0x6c | 0x204
Size of Raw Data |0x1000 | 0x24000 | 0x1000 | 0x1000

I think it is not packed/obfuscated

And from *PEiD* also not packed

## Dependency Walker

*Meaningful dependency*

* ConnectNamedPipe (create a server pipe for interprocess communication that will wait for a client pipe to connect)
* CreateFile (Creates or opens a file or I/O device.)
* CreateFileMapping (loads a file into memory and makes it accessible via memory address. Launchers, loaders and injectors use this function to read and modify PE files)
* CreateProcess

It is a Trojan virus, inject into thread and write into files and try to erase the trace also with connection to hacker's computer to transform data back

## Strings

Honestly I tried to run it on my WindowsXP VM not Nothing seems happend...

Here is part of result from `strings Lab01-01.exe` 

```
C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll
Kernel32.
Lab01-01.dll
C:\Windows\System32\Kernel32.dll
```

And from `strings Lab01-01.dll` 

```
127.26.152.13
```

So I guess it will write a `kerne132.dll` and hmm wake `Lab01-01.dll` then open a back door to the special ip??

That's the story line I guess
