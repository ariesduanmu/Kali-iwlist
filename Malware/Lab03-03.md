## Strings

* Binary with lots junks(A)

## Dependency Walker

* CreateFile
* ReadFile
* WriteFile

(and lots process stuff)
But based ob PEiD is it not packed(I don't believe)

## Dynamic Anaylysis

### Process Monitor

* it create `svchost.exe` hmm seems to be something important and from Regshot nothing been added so this `svchost.exe` should exist before so this exe **replace** the `svchost.exe`

## Process Explorer

* here we saw svchost.exe there running alone and check it's property there parent `Lab03-03.exe`
* and the pid is 1776
* so go back the Process Monitor, there we filter PID is 1776
* it keeping write and create file in `practicalmalwareanalysis.log`
* so let's check what's in it 
* something like 
```
[Enter]
[Window: Command Prompt]
cd
```
